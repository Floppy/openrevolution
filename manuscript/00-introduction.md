# Introduction

Many books have been written about the future of democracy, about how we can do things
better in the future.

This isn't one of those books.

There are also books on how politics works and how to get elected, full of advice
from expert campaigners.

This isn't one of those books either.

This is the story of how I'm trying to apply some modern democratic ideas to the
real world, right now, and of how I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

In May 2015, I'm standing for the UK national parliament, on an open set of ideas
that *anyone* can contribute to, a truly collaborative political platform.

I'm not a politician; I'm an engineer who has worked with software and technology
all his life, so I have absolutely no experience in this area.

The advantage of not knowing anything is that I have to learn it all; and that means
that I can share it with you. This book is mostly rewritten from blog posts that
I'm writing as I go along, with a bit of reworking. I will share everything I learn,
everything I have to do, and all the decisions that need to be made.

My aim is to show that democracy (at least in the UK) doesn't have to be mystifying,
or inaccessible; it's open to everyone to participate in, we just forget that
sometimes.

If I can take part, then so can you, and if you're angry or frustrated with the state
of politics, then you have a responsibility to try and provide a better idea.

This book is not neutral. It will contain Opinions. However, those opinions will
mostly be about the process of democracy and engagement, rather than other policy
matters (like health, welfare, defence, etc).

As long as you're in favour of trying to re-engage people with democracy
and open it up beyond our current political class, you won't find anything too
offensive here.

If you want to know about the entire platform that I'm standing on, go read (and
edit) the [OpenPolitics Manifesto](http://openpolitics.org.uk).

One more point: this book is being written as I go along, using LeanPub, which lets
you publish work-in-progress revisions of your book as you go along. That means that
(a) it's not finished yet, but (b) you can give me your feedback and make it better!
